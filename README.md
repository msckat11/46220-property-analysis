# Property Analysis 

Topic: Analysis of Marion County Property Records 

Rationale: Indianapolis is a growing and developing city and as citizens, we are interested in seeing how the housing market and population are developing. With the information found, we will be able to visualize different aspects of the housing population throughout indianapolis. 

Dataset: Our dataset was procured from the Indiana State Public Records Department via an unnamed text document. After some ETL work the dataset was cleaned up and is uploaded via CSV in this GitHub under the title "county49.csv". More than 750,000 records were eliminated from the CSV to limit the data.
