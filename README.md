# Property Analysis 

Topic: Analysis of Marion County Property Records 

Rationale: Indianapolis is a growing and developing city and as citizens, we are interested in seeing how the housing market and population are developing. With the information found, we will be able to visualize different aspects of the housing population throughout indianapolis. 

Dataset: Our dataset was procured from the Indiana State Public Records Department via an unnamed text document. After some ETL work the dataset was cleaned up and is uploaded via CSV in this GitHub under the title "county49.csv". More than 750,000 records were eliminated from the CSV to limit the data. 

Possible Topics to Analyze: 

    1. A visualization of the properties that are owned by individuals outside of the state of Indiana.
    2. A heat map that visualizes properties by "date transferred" to determine the turnover rate of homes. 
    3. A visualization for the average property value per neighborhood via the "neighborhood ID"
    4. A color-coded map or chart that demonstrates the properties by "property class code". Each code has a detailed description of the type of property so that we can visualize the type of properties that are distributed throughout Indianapolis. 
    5. A map that shows the townships throughout Indy by using the "township number" data
